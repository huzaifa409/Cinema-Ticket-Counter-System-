# 🎟️ Cinema Ticket Counter System

A simple and structured **Cinema Ticket Booking System** developed in Java.  
This project simulates the workflow of a cinema ticket counter — managing movies, showtimes, tickets, and customer interactions.  
Perfect for **university projects**, **Java OOP practice**, and **system design learning**.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Cinema Ticket Counter System** allows a cashier/operator to manage movies and issue tickets for available showtimes.  
The system is designed with clear object-oriented principles and a modular architecture so it can be easily extended into a more advanced cinema management platform.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎬 **Movie Management**  
  Add, view, and list available movies.

- 🕒 **Showtime Management**  
  Display movie showtimes (static or dynamic based on your implementation).

- 🎫 **Ticket Booking**  
  Issue tickets for selected shows.

- 👤 **Customer Handling**  
  Record basic customer ticket information.

- 📦 **Simple OOP Architecture**  
  Clean code structure for easy understanding and expansion.

> *(Customize these based on your actual implementation.)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java (Core Java)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Console-based user interface** (or GUI if included)
- **In-memory data / file storage** (depending on your code)
